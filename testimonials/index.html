      <h2>KITTY SPENCER, THE ROYAL WEDDING, 29TH APRIL 2011</h2>
      <p>Hello Mikaela,</p>
      <p>I&rsquo;m so sorry to bother you on a weekend. I got your number from Carol Gibson Jackson. I am desperately trying to find someone to do my make-up for the Royal Wedding on Friday. I was told that you are the best and the person I should contact so I was just wondering if you&rsquo;re available and how much you charge, etc? We have to leave for Westminster Abbey at 7.30am, so my fingers are crossed that you&rsquo;re available!</p>

      <h2>KATE &amp; ALISTAIR MURRAY, KEW GARDENS, LONDON</h2>
      <p>The scheduled make-up person for my wedding fell through two days before the big day and luckily my hair stylist provided me with Mikaela&rsquo;s details. Straight away Mikaela was absolutely lovely and reworked her plans to fit me and my whole wedding party into her busy schedule &mdash; even when she was preparing for a big trip away the next day! As for the result, I was not only happy with her overall skills and quality products, but I honestly never felt more beautiful and was over-the-moon that I still looked like &lsquo;me&rsquo;. She made my skin look flawless, my eyes &lsquo;pop&rsquo; and knew exactly what was needed to ensure I had the desired effect in my photographs. In the end, I felt like it was meant to be that my initial artist fell through as I couldn&rsquo;t imagine anyone else doing my makeup! I would recommend her to anyone.</p>

      <h2>MR AMIR &amp; MRS ELSA SAEIDIANI, SICILY, ITALY</h2>
      <p>After seeing only a handful of films Chris had gracefully mastered, our decision was affirmed to entrust the capturing of our memories to him. The passion he exerted to provide the highest quality results speaks volumes for his professionalism and commitment. Our friendship with Chris continued to grow over the following months as preparations for the wedding were finalized. We remained confident in his ability due to his reputation and credentials in the business. As the events unfolded on the day of our wedding, Chris gracefully and discreetly captured every moment of the festivities. He applied his knowledge, equipment, talents, but most of all his creativity to provide the highest possible quality.</p>
      <p>My wife and I are always reminded of the greatest wedding gift we received, every time we see ourselves in the most magnificent visual display of our memories.</p>

      <h2>BIANCA &amp; JONATHAN  MORTON,  SOUTH KENSINGTON, LONDON</h2>
      <p>Mikaela is an exceptional make-up artist. She understood the natural look that I wanted to achieve for my wedding and made me, as well as my bridesmaids, into the best versions of ourselves. Though her skill and professionalism are enough to recommend her, Mikaela is also a pleasure to spend time with. She is friendly, thoughtful, and a very calming presence, which is particularly important on your wedding day. I love her work and if I could, I would have her do my makeup every day!</p>

      <h2>MARY &amp; JAMIE CLARK, RICHMOND, SURREY</h2>
      <p>Mikaela did the most fantastic job with my wedding make-up.</p>
      <p>I was immediately reassured in our initial chat over the phone, as she understood straight away what I wanted &mdash; a fresh, natural look where I still looked and felt like me.</p>
      <p>At the make-up trial she did exactly what I had in mind but much better. I was a bit unsure about wearing false eyelashes but went with it anyway, and they looked great in the end. She was great fun and lovely to chat to, and her skill, experience and professionalism put me totally at ease so I had no doubt that she would do a great job on the wedding day.</p>
      <p>On the big day she arrived exactly on time and was a cheery, calm presence amid the mayhem.</p>
      <p>I never expected I could look so good: I felt radiant and confident and had a brilliant day. The make-up stayed on all day and everyone commented on how beautiful I looked.</p>
      <p>Thanks a million, Mikaela, I can&rsquo;t recommend you highly enough!</p>

      <h2>FLORENCE &amp; ARTHUR JEFFES, TUSCANY, ITALY</h2>
      <p>I had planned to do my own make-up on my wedding day, but am so pleased Mikaela was there with me for the last precious hours! While I wanted to look perfect walking down the aisle, what was much more important was feeling brilliant and excited. I ended up looking beautiful, but also felt wonderful and confident, all thanks to Mikaela! Her calm and supportive nature combined with her flair for creativity and her unique skill as an artist makes her the perfect person to be with you before your ceremony &mdash; I cannot recommend her enough!</p>

      <h2>SACHA &amp; KIT LYNCH ROBINSON, NORFOLK, ENGLAND</h2>
      <p>Mikaela is a genius! When she did my make up on my special day, I was exhausted and looked terrible.  I was sleep-deprived as our first daughter, being only 2 months, kept me up the previous night. As I don&rsquo;t wear much make up, Mikaela designed a look that was natural, cool and made me look fresh and rested. The morning was a bit chaotic and even though she had her time with me cut short, she was very efficient and supportive and took control of the situation. Amazing! Ten stars!!</p>
